## Empirics and ethics of machine learning-guided prioritization

In this cluster of papers, I examine (1) the role of supervised machine learning in improving equity in civil rights enforcement, (2) the role that new tools from machine learning can play in helping researchers better connect theory to evidence in quantitative sociology, and (3) public views of and new methods for using large-scale genotyping data in policy-relevant contexts.

- **Abstract**: We make only one point in this article. Every quantitative study must be able to answer the question: what is your estimand? The estimand is the target quantity—the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis—the theoretical estimand—in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to theory.

## Ethics and decision-making at the nexus of healthcare and K-12 education

In this cluster of papers, I examine institutional linkages between two sectors that help people living with disabilities: (1) the healthcare sector, which takes responsibility for medical aspects of disability and (2) K-12 school districts, which take responsibility for disability as they impact learning-related outcomes. I study the role of parents and patient advocacy groups in both defining which institutions take responsibility for disability and decision-making within those institutions. Other papers examine the role of disease stigma in shaping public views of people with disabilities and moral questions about payment for participation in medical research.
