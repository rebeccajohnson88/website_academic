Welcome to my site! I'm an Assistant Professor at Dartmouth College in <a href="https://qss.dartmouth.edu/">Quantitative Social Science</a>, affiliated with the Department of Sociology and Consortium of Studies in Race, Migration, and Sexuality (RMS). I'm also a 2020-2021 Access to Justice Faculty Scholar with the <a href="http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/research/Fellowshipopportunities/ABF_JPB_Foundation_Access_to_Justice_Scholars_Program0/2020_Access_to_Justice_Scholars.html">American Bar Foundation</a>, an academic affiliate with the federal <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a>, and a visiting Data Science Fellow with <a href="https://thelab.dc.gov/">The Lab at DC</a>.

My research studies how social service bureaucracies use a mix of data and discretion to decide who deserve help and focuses particularly on prioritization in K-12 schools. Substantively, I study how underfunded K-12 districts navigate three forces: legal mandates about categories of students to prioritize, fiscal realities, and family advocacy. Methodologically, I use a variety of methods, including tools from causal inference, computational text analysis, machine learning, interviews, and field experiments with large-scale administrative data. Other research focuses on prioritization in other areas of social policy, including housing, COVID-19 relief, and civil rights enforcement.
